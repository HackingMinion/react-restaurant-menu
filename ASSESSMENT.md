## Notes


### Node.js

Use node.js version: 10.16.0. You can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you have an other version of node installed (check it by typing **node --version** in your CLI), consider using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage multiple active node.js versions and to switch between them.
Get the nvm for Linux / Mac OS [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
Get the equivalent for Windows [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) 

### React

React is may way to go and using [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to start.

I was thinking about [https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/), but seems much like an overkill for this rather small application.
